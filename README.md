READ THIS: The trial has expired and the only way to continue using the software is to ACTIVATE the product through INTERNET using a unique and STRONG PRODUCT ID. If the user is really a legal buyer of your software then this software checks for the payment information in the INTERNET DATABASE while ACTIVATING. If the information is matched then the product wll be activated. Even if the PRODUCT ID is cracked by some means- it must be verified through internet and if the payment information is not found or invalid then this software will not be activated. Believe me this is the best way to secure your software and there is no room for any cracking.
